No where was this more true than in The Angel, Angel on a fateful night in February as we sat down to complete our 10th #Wetherspoons. As our earlier drinks were winding up and our friends parted ways, we ventured into the night to find The Angel. As its name would surely suggest, it&#39;s only a short walk from Angel station. As we entered, little did we know that we&#39;d soon be leaving, not with the taste of reasonably priced beer, but of bitter disappointment fresh in our mouths. The Angel boasts no more finery or intrigue than any other Spoons. Indeed, it is an altogether average place in its looks. The disparate and disinterested crowd did little to lift our spirits as we approached the bar. Lawrence kindly ordered two pints, paying with his phone. As we sat down we were quickly joined by the barman, a jaded but determined look on his face. With a certain conviction in his tone, he explained we hadn&#39;t paid for our pints. Lawrence deftly unlocked his phone and brought up the application. As clear as day the screen displayed the transaction was complete: &#34;¬£6.90, The Angel&#34;. There was little to debate around this, might I add, fairly reasonable price. The manager was soon called over and insisted we hadn&#39;t paid. Naturally, we refused to pay twice. We had reached an impasse. It would not last long however. There is a technique relied upon by many of the great mediators of the past, a last resort in times of desperate negotiation; our half finished pints were snatched from our hands and we were escorted from the premises. Our pathetic protests fell on deaf ears as we passed the other punters and shuffled towards the door. We hit the sobering night air outside having for the first time felt the full weight of JD Wetherspoon. Our spirits crushed and our resolve broken, we made the short walk to Angel station, and headed home. üè† = 0 üë™ = 0 üí∑ =  2 #AllTheSpoons  #jobsworths</a></p> <p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;">A post shared by AllTheSpoons (@allthespoons) on <time style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;" datetime="2017-05-16T06:58:28+00:00">May 15, 2017 at 11:58pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote>
